          Welcome to my first Website created after joining ALT School. Am sure
          it's not perfect but will become as I learn more. This website was an
          assessment to test our skills so far and we were instructed not to use
          CSS (csacading style sheet) which could have made it more attractive
          and user friendly. However I did my best in following all instuctions
          to create this masterpeice.I hope I get the highest grade.

          Hi! My name is RASHEED SAUDAH and I'm a 21-year-old lady. I am a
          student at ALT School Engineering Program for year 2024 set with the
          <b>Student ID:ALT/SOE/024/0445.</b>Even though I'm just getting
          started in life, I've already had some amazing experiences that have
          helped shape who I am today. I was born and raised in Lagos State
          Nigeria with my parents and my 5 younger siblings, being the first
          born isn't always easy. This experience made realise I had to become
          an independent lady and be ready to face the challenges that may break
          me down or stop me from purchasing my dreams. One of the things I
          loved most about growing up was being able to help others and not
          relying on others too much. My parents weren't the social type so I
          ended up being an introvert which I don't argue about because it fits
          my personality honourably.

      <h2 id="goals">Reason & Goal</h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          There are many reasons why I choosed to join Alt School Programme.
          From the moment I met my uncle who studied chemistry typing codes in
          VScode, I knew this school offered a unique environment that would
          allow me to become a Full Stack Engineer despite my background in
          Computer Science and develop as a well-rounded individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          ALT School is renowned for its rigorous curriculum and diverse course
          offerings in IT. I'm particularly interested in Software Engineering
          aspect because of It offers a dynamic career with global impact,
          diverse applications, and strong financial prospects. The opportunity
          to learn from well renowed tech industry experts who are actively
          trying to make the path easier for upcoming Software Engineers is
          especially exciting because it helps keep me motivated and see them as
          mentors who will help us when we fall back and give us the courage to
          be back on track.

              <b>Beyond the Classroom</b>
              ALT School understands that learning extends beyond textbooks and
              lectures. I'm eager to participate in the school's vibrant
              community platforms, and Circles. Learning Circles particularly
              appeals to me because it's an avenue that will make students
              active and get challenged by their circle mates which I like
              bacause it makes me willing to know more. Additionally, Grooming
              students for great CV skills, Interships, Recommendations will
              allow me to be more confident to step into the tech world üåè.

              <b>Supportive Community</b>
              The sense of community at ALT School is truly special. The weekly
              live class is a very brillant approach to foster leraning among
              students, although contents from the video lessons are almost
              different from the live class but its a great approach to increase
              collaboration among students. I believe this environment will
              foster opportunities for personal growth, and strong relationships
              with peers.

              Attending ALT School is not just about academics and
              extracurriculars; it's about becoming the best version of myself.
              I hope to become a software engineer and learn to collaborate
              effectively with others. ALT School provides the resources and
              support system to help me become more confident in my career. ALT
              School perfectly aligns with my academic goals, personal
              interests, and desire to grow within a supportive community. I'm
              confident that this school will challenge me, inspire me, and
              prepare me for a bright future.
