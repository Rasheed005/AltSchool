        My name is Rasheed Saudah Anuoluwapo Golden, and I am from a small town
        in Ogun state, Nigeria. Growing up with strict parents and in a
        close-knit community has shaped who I am today and taught me the
        importance of family and friendship, I was brought up in an Islamic home
        where being able to speak arabic was an obligation. I must say I was
        blessed with a good and amazing mother. This poem describes my love for
        my mother.

        One of my proudest achievements was winning the first place throught my
        Secondary School (SS1 - SSS3) as a science Student. However, I have also
        faced challenges, such as balancing my academic responsibilities with

        the importance of time management and perseverance.

        Looking ahead, I plan to take more online courses and attend conferences
        to be able to connect with Senior developers and entrepreneurs who are
        willing to make a positive impact in my Vision. My long-term goal is to
        become the CEO of my own tech company like Microsoft and Meta.
        Ultimately, I want to make a positive impact on the world and inspire
        others to invest into technology. I believe that with determination and
        a positive attitude, we can achieve anything we set our minds to. And I
        also believe that there are things in life that money can't buy.
